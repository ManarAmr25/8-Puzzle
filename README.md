# 8-Puzzle
 **8-puzzle AI solver using BFS, DFS, A-star algorithms with a GUI. The A-star algorithm can apply one of 2 heuristics. The first is the Manhattan distance between a tile's current and original position, the second uses the Euclidian distance instead**

### How to run ?
1. Enter an initial state in the text field below the puzzle for the agent to solve. A state should be a sequence of digits from 1 to 9, all are unique.
   - EX : the following state is represented as **"125340678"**    <br/>

2. Click on one of the 4 algorithms (the blue buttons) to start solving with one of these algorithms. The program then starts showing the steps.
3. Click on stop button to stop the run.
